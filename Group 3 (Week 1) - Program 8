# Program 8: An employee’s total weekly pay equals the hourly wage multiplied by the total number of regular hours plus any overtime pay. Overtime pay equals the total overtime hours multiplied by 1.5 times the hourly wage. 
# Write a program that takes as inputs the hourly wage, total regular hours, and total overtime hours and displays an employee’s total weekly pay. 
# Mark George (Group 3)

# create/instantiate variables
hourly_wage = float(input("Enter the hourly wage: "))
regular_hours = float(input("Enter the total regular hours: "))
overtime_hours = float(input("Enter the total overtime hours: "))

# calculations
overtime_pay = overtime_hours * (1.5 * hourly_wage)
total_weekly_pay = (regular_hours * hourly_wage) + overtime_pay

print("Employee's total weekly pay: $", total_weekly_pay)
