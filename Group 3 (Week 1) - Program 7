# Program 7: Light travels at 3 * 108 meters per second. A light-year is the distance a light beam travels in one year. 
# Write a program that calculates and displays the value of a light-year.

# create/instantiate variables
speed_of_light = 3 * 10**8  # this is the speed of light in m/s

# calculations
seconds_per_year = seconds_per_minute * minutes_per_hour * hours_per_day * days_per_year
light_year = speed_of_light * seconds_per_year
